Outside of sweeping, the actions the subject performs can be broken into two categories: reluctantly cooperative versus self-willed. 

Performing the reluctant actions / movements, there is a stronger sense of voyeurism present; she is aware of her being watched and has a acute loathing for her oppressor. You are performing because it is your duty to entertain. The goal of these actions is to provide the audience a measure of certain control over the entire experience.

Performing the self-willed actions, there is a sense of weight about them and emotion to them. The goal of the charged actions is to give the audience a sense of empathy and curiosity about the subject; watching her, we should experience her as having agency, choice, and a character of her own. But in this way, we sacrifice  a sense of control over her. There is a feeling of disobedience and rebellion in her actions; she uses the objects and actions as a means to escape.
